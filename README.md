  <i>I'm much more of a developer than a designer per say, so I took a lot of inspiration from some amazing people, see the Credits section :)</i>

### Credits

- The cursor follwing effect and "magnetic" text is the artwork of [Cuberto](www.cuberto.com) - [Demo Repo](www.github.com/Cuberto/cursor-magnetic-demo).
- The orb background effect is based on a great tutorial by [George Francis](www.georgefrancis.dev/writing/create-a-generative-landing-page-and-webgl-powered-background/).
- The svg animation on the loading screen was created by [Andreas Storm on Codepen](https://www.codepen.io/avstorm/pen/RwNzPNN).

### Quirks

- `docs` is the "public" directory (it's served by Github Pages)
- I wanted this to be as simple as possible while looking how I want, so I ended up going with a fairly light Vite with Vanilla JS combo :)
